You'll need to have AWS credentials, and a target AWS account.

## 1. Bootstrap the account

```bash
yarn
npx cdk bootstrap --profile yourprofile
```

## 2. Deploy the OIDCSetup stack into the target account

```bash
npx cdk deploy --profile yourprofile
```

## 3. Generate the Github Action for Deployment

Now if you run:

```bash
npm run build
```

the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` will be generated.
Now if you commit and push, and merge to main, deployments will be kicked off ‚ö°Ô∏è

# Dev

To deploy the dev stage to your AWS account, but not through the pipeline for development, you'll want to run:

```bash
npm run deploy -- --profile yourprofile --app 'cdk.out/assembly-dev-stage'
```
